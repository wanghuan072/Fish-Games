        <h2>What is the Fish Games Collection?</h2>
        <p>This collection is for players who enjoy light and casual entertainment, focusing on small-scale <strong>fishing</strong> and <strong>fish-catching</strong> titles for both web and mobile platforms. Our goal is to gather scattered fish-themed games into one clean entry point, so you can find “click and play” titles in the shortest time possible.</p>
        <p>The concept is simple: no overly complex reviews, no jargon overload—just clear categories and direct play info, letting more players enjoy the thrill of catching fish or the calm of casting a line without pressure.</p>
  
        <h2>How We Select Games</h2>
        <p>To ensure a consistent, relaxing experience, we use straightforward criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instant Play:</strong> Quick loading, simple flow, no lengthy tutorials.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Barrier Controls:</strong> Core interactions are intuitive, playable with one hand or minimal keys.</li>
          <li><strong>Time-Friendly:</strong> Short session length, perfect for commutes or breaks.</li>
          <li><strong>Comfortable Presentation:</strong> Light but polished visuals and sound, with either a relaxing or upbeat style.</li>
          <li><strong>Sustainable Updates:</strong> Active development or a healthy player community for long-term playability.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Gameplay Highlights</h2>
        <p>The fun in fish games often comes from “simple actions + instant feedback.” Here are some common highlights you’ll find in the collection:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fast-Paced Catching:</strong> Clear combo and visual effects for instant satisfaction.</li>
          <li><strong>Relaxed Fishing:</strong> Cast, bite, reel in—steady rhythm with both atmosphere and collection fun.</li>
          <li><strong>Light Progression:</strong> Basic upgrades, fish catalogues, and daily goals for mild progression.</li>
          <li><strong>Casual Social Features:</strong> Leaderboards or simple multiplayer lobbies for added engagement.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Platforms & Device Support</h2>
        <p>The collection prioritizes <strong>web</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> versions for quick-access gameplay. Mobile titles are optimized for stable performance, while web games run smoothly on major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari). We also note whether each game supports offline play, touch controls, and portrait/landscape orientation.</p>
  
        <h2>Update Schedule & Feedback</h2>
        <p>The collection is continuously updated, with new entries and tag refinements added over time. If you have a favorite <strong>fish game</strong> worth including, you can submit it via our site’s feedback channel—we’ll review and add it as soon as possible.</p>
