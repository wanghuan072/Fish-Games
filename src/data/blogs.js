      <p>Maintaining a healthy aquarium is both an art and a science. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced aquarist, understanding the fundamentals of fish care is essential for creating a thriving aquatic ecosystem.</p>
      
      <h2>Water Quality Management</h2>
      <p>The foundation of successful fishkeeping lies in maintaining excellent water quality. Regular testing of pH levels, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates is crucial for your fish's health.</p>
      
      <h3>Essential Water Parameters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Most tropical fish thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water (6.5-7.5)</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Maintain consistent temperature appropriate for your fish species</li>
        <li><strong>Ammonia & Nitrites:</strong> Should always be at 0 ppm</li>
        <li><strong>Nitrates:</strong> Keep below 20 ppm through regular water changes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Feeding Your Fish</h2>
      <p>Proper nutrition is vital for fish health and longevity. Overfeeding is one of the most common mistakes new aquarists make.</p>
      
      <h3>Feeding Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Feed small amounts 2-3 times daily</li>
        <li>Only provide what fish can consume in 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Vary the diet with high-quality flakes, pellets, and occasional treats</li>
        <li>Remove uneaten food to prevent water contamination</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Tank Maintenance Schedule</h2>
      <p>Establishing a regular maintenance routine is key to long-term success:</p>
      
      <h3>Weekly Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>25-30% water change</li>
        <li>Vacuum substrate</li>
        <li>Clean algae from glass</li>
        <li>Test water parameters</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Monthly Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean filter media</li>
        <li>Trim aquatic plants</li>
        <li>Deep clean decorations</li>
        <li>Check equipment functionality</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By following these guidelines and maintaining consistency in your care routine, you'll create an environment where your aquatic friends can flourish for years to come.</p>
